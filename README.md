# Pimp My XSLT

This is the repository for the website at https://pimpmyxslt.com/ which I've
moved from an old Umbraco site to now being hosted with GitHub Pages.

(The files were always static files â€” the Umbraco site was only ever used for
the XPath Axes Visualizer, which I'm in the process of recreating without the
need for serverside transformations).

Have fun!
