			If you&#8217;ve been working on a multi-language website in Umbraco, you&#8217;ve probably
	        been using the Dictionary for the miscellaneous labels that occur throughout the site, e.g., form
	        labels, headers, error messages etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			I&#8217;ll show you how I&#8217;ve been handling this in my (XSLT) macros, and hopefully there&#8217;s
			something for you to use the next time you&#8217;re about to use the Dictionary Items in XSLT.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

	<p>To use the Dictionary we need to do a couple of things first:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>We should create the languages we need (Settings > Languages)</li>
		<li>We need to assign a Domain &amp; Language to the top-level node(s) in our website</li>
	</ol>

	<p>When that&#8217;s done, we can go ahead and create some Dictionary Items for use in our site.</p>

	<h2>The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work</h2>

	<p>
		In short, if you&#8217;ve created a Dictionary Item called &#8220;SearchTitle&#8221;, you can get the localized
		version of that item using the GetDictionaryItem() method in umbraco.library - like this:
	</p>

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/938957.js?file=dictionary-items-01.xslt"></script>
	
	<p>
		Umbraco will decide which language the current request belongs to and pick the assigned value for the
		key &#8220;SearchTitle&#8221;, which it will return to the XSLT.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is all fine and dandy, and you can fetch any Dictionary Item you&#8217;ve created using this call,
		but soon your code will start to look like it could use a good refactoring. I&#8217;d say that if you&#8217;re
		fetching more than a few items you should start to get that &#8220;Um, I guess it must be possible to not call
		that library function all the time&#8230;&#8221; feeling&#8230;
	</p>

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/938957.js?file=dictionary-items-02.xslt"></script>
	
	<h2>Refactor &amp; Pluralize!</h2>

	<p>
		So apparently the Core team got that feeling too and decided to give us (totally free of course) a way to
		fetch more than one Dictionary Item at a time, by creating the <code>GetDictionaryItems()</code> method. Good call.
	</p>

	<p>It works like this: In the Dictionary you create some items below a top-level item, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary
    SearchLabels
        SearchTitle
        SearchButtonText
        SearchFieldPlaceholder
</code></pre>

	<p>When you call the pluralized method with the key &#8220;SearchLabels&#8221; you get the following XML back:</p>

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/938957.js?file=dictionary-items-03.xml"></script>
	
	<p>You should of course put that into a variable so you have access to all the labels returned:</p>

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/938957.js?file=dictionary-items-04.xslt"></script>

	<h2>OK, That Didn&#8217;t Help</h2>

	<p>
		While this will make sure that we only call the library funtion once, it won&#8217;t exactly make our
		code look less cluttered:
	</p>

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/938957.js?file=dictionary-items-05.xslt"></script>

	<p>But of course there&#8217;s a way around that - but first a little detour.</p>

	<h2 id="lost">Managing Lots Of Dictionary Items</h2>

	<p>
		You may already have tried to create a bunch of Dictionary Items, nested in a couple of levels, and
		subsequently tried to fetch them all in one swoop with the <code>GetDictionaryItems()</code> method. Then you&#8217;ve
		also encountered the limitation/feature of it not returning more than one level of items, i.e., you can only
		access the children of an item, neither grandchildren nor grandchildren&#8217;s children etc.
	</p>

	<p>
		What I do is to structure the Dictionary Items below one level of &#8220;headers&#8221;, so the first level of items
		are all wrappers for the items under them. This makes it pretty easy to organize the items in sections that
		match the pages they&#8217;re used in.
	</p>

	<p>But we need to have easy access to them from XSLT. Enter secret weapon #4815162342 - joining nodesets&#8230;</p>

	<p>Let&#8217;s say I have three sections of Dictionary Items; &#8220;Frontpage&#8221;, &#8220;Search&#8221; and &#8220;Products&#8221;.</p>

	<p>What I do in XSLT is this: </p>

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/938957.js?file=dictionary-items-06.xslt"></script>

	<p>
		By way of making the individual variables select just the <code>DictionaryItem</code> elements, the resulting <code>$labels</code>
		variable can be used simply like this to get any label from the three sets:
	</p>

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/938957.js?file=dictionary-items-07.xslt"></script>

	<p>
		Happiness prevails in my code now - I&#8217;m down to saying &#8220;Give me the label with the key &#8216;SearchButtonText&#8217;&#8221;
		and no excess calls to umbraco.library.
	</p>

	<h2>Hey, What About The Bonus???</h2>

	<p>Bonus? Oh yes, how could I forget :-)</p>

	<p>
		Well, if you&#8217;re processing some custom XML or you&#8217;ve named your Dictionary Items after the
		properties on a Document Type, you can use a &#8220;moded template&#8221; to handle some of your labels.
	</p>

	<p>The template looks like this:</p>

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/938957.js?file=dictionary-items-08.xslt"></script>

	<p>
		Then if you have a <code>NewsItem</code> DocumentType with a <code>newsDate</code> property, you could use it like this to get
		the translated value for the &#8216;Date&#8217; label:
	</p>

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/938957.js?file=dictionary-items-09.xslt"></script>

	<p>
		These kinds of abstractions definitely suit my person well &#8212; your milage may vary, as they say, but
		nevertheless I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed another article, and that you&#8217;ll continue to improve your
		XSLT skills every day.
