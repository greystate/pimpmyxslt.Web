			I&#8217;ve been asked about how to include and reuse XSLT in multiple files a number of times,
			so I thought it would make a good candidate for a new &#8216;Pimp My XSLT&#8217; article. Enjoy, and don&#8217;t

	<p>
		When you&#8217;ve got some kind of functionality that&#8217;s ripe for reuse, you can choose between two similar
		ways of bringing that functionality from a separate stylesheet file into any other stylesheet, when needed.
	</p>

	<h2>&lt;xsl:include href=&#8221;&#8230;&#8221; /&gt;</h2>

	<p>
		The first is using the <code>xsl:include</code> instruction, and you simply put it where you&#8217;d like the included templates
		to be, if you were to just copy and paste them right into the new file.
	</p>

	<p>
		So I have this file &#8212; MediaHelper.xslt &#8212; with some templates to handle the &#8220;GetMedia Dance&#8221;
		of getting the node from the Media section etc. Here&#8217;s the basic idea:
	</p>

	<h3>File: MediaHelper.xslt</h3>

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/938971.js?file=include-or-import-01.xslt"></script>

	<p>
		I can use the Media Helper above by including it in my new shiny &#8220;Render Page Image&#8221; macro:
	</p>

	<h3>File: RenderPageImage.xslt</h3>

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/938971.js?file=include-or-import-02.xslt"></script>

	<p>
		Great - now all my macros can have simple media rendering, just by including that one file.
		And if I need to support PDF files as well, I can choose to add a simple template to either of those files,
		depending on whether it&#8217;s only for that specific project (in the macro) or more generally (in the helper):
	</p>

	<h3>Template: PDF file rendering</h3>
	
	<script src="https://gist.github.com/938971.js?file=include-or-import-03.xslt"></script>

	<p>
		Because <code>xsl:include</code> inserts the templates at the point of which the instruction is placed, it&#8217;s easy
		to override a template in the included file, just by placing it <em>after</em> the <code>xsl:include</code> instruction, e.g.:
	</p>

	<h3>File: RenderVersionedPageImage.xslt</h3>

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/938971.js?file=include-or-import-04.xslt"></script>

	<p>
		(If two templates in the same stylesheet end up matching the same element, the last one defined will
		effectively &#8220;win&#8221; the precedence battle for that element).
	</p>


	<blockquote>
	  <p>So what&#8217;s the need for another option, then? You said there were two ways of doing this&#8230;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<hr />
	
	<h2 id="lost">&lt;xsl:import href=&quot;&#8230;&quot; /&gt;</h2>

	<p>
		Okay, right.
		So - let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re  on this new project and there&#8217;s some strict policy that all images
		and files must be served wrapped in a pair of comments, stating the &#8216;last updated&#8217; date and the user who saved it (obviously
		for reasons you are not cleared to know about. &#8220;Just do it&#8221;, you&#8217;re told), e.g. like this:
	</p>

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/938971.js?file=include-or-import-05.html"></script>

	<p>
		You could of course just copy the <strong>Image</strong> and <strong>File</strong> templates to the main file, and place them after the include instruction, like
		we did in the example above, and then add the secret comments to both template copies.
	</p>

	<p>
		You could, however, also try the <code>xsl:import</code> instruction instead, as it lets you do something a little smarter,
		ridding your precious and modular code from the horror that is duplication. <abbr title="Don&#8217;t Repeat Youself">DRY</abbr>, they say&#8230;
	</p>

	<p>
		Using the <code>xsl:import</code> instruction is just as easy as with <code>xsl:include</code>, though it has to
		go <strong>before</strong> any other childnode of the main stylesheet.
	</p>

	<h3>File: RenderTimeStampedImages.xslt</h3>

	<script src="https://gist.github.com/938971.js?file=include-or-import-06.xslt"></script>

	<p>
		As you can see, using the <code>xsl:import</code> instruction lets you override the imported templates, but at the same time,
		has the ability to execute the original, preserving its context, via the <code>xsl:apply-imports</code> instruction.
	</p>

	<hr />

	<p>
		So there you have it - two ways to include common functionality from another stylesheet, thus making it easier to
		reuse some of the code you&#8217;ve already written. Hopefully this will help you decide which of the two
		to choose, from project to project.
	</p>

	<p class="critical">
		Regardless what method you choose, be sure to install <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/projects/developer-tools/xsltouch" title="Go get the brilliant XSLTouchnow!">XSLTouch</a>
		if you&#8217;re using Umbraco/.NET, to not have to worry about remembering to save the main file when you change something in the includes (!)
	</p>

	<p>Thanks for reading all the way down here, and for putting up with all the LOST references :-)</p>
